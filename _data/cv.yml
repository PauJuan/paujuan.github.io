        # - title: Abstract
        #   contents:
        #     - The water sector faces uncertainty due to climate change and its impact on infrastructure. To handle unpredictable changes, utilities must develop resilience. However, the application of resilience in water management is still in its early stages.
        #     - This thesis explored the implementation of resilience in water resource recovery facilities (WRRF) and identified implementation challenges. It also proposed a framework to measure resilience using modeling techniques. The thesis included calibrating and validating a WRRF model at full scale using dynamic aeration modeling. This model was used to test the proposed framework's effectiveness in handling two stressors stormwater and power outage.
