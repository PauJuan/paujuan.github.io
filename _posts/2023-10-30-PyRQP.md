I have written an open source version of the Environment Agency's River Quality Planning (RQP) software in Python<d-footnote>Juan-Garcia, P. (2023, October 17). PauJuan/PyRQP Open source River Quality Planning software written in Python. GitHub. https://github.com/PauJuan/PyRQP </d-footnote>. I wanted to create a version that is transparent, extendable and easy to automate.

Please feel free to check the repository at <https://github.com/PauJuan/PyRQP>

In this post I will discuss what RQP is, some fundamentals on how it works and provide an example to use it.

### RQP

RQP is one of the main tools used for discharge permitting and water management in the UK. The main purpose of the tool is to simulate the mixing of two inputs (generally a river and a discharge) to estimate the distribution of the output concentration of the downstream mixing zone. Typical uses of the tool would be to determine the possible impact of an increased flow discharged at a location, or the quality required at a given discharge to meet a specific water quality standard downstream of the discharge. RQP is the model underpinning the functionality implemented by the [Environment Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency)'s catchment simulator SIMCAT and [UKWIR](https://ukwir.org/)'s [SAGIS](https://sagis.ukwir.org/sagis/welcome).

There are two key points underlying the methodology of the RQP tool:
1.	The input data are correlated. That is, they are dependent on one another and change together to a certain degree.
2.	It is possible to simulate the mix of two distributions by using a numerical method such as Monte Carlo (i.e., repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results).

These are explained a continuation.

### Correlation

RQP generates four sets of random correlated data based on each parameter's distributions, which are generally considered to be lognormal. The parameters are: river flow, discharge flow, river concentration and discharge concentration. The following is a graphical representation of what this looks like for river flow and quality. The correlation between river flow and discharge flow is typically 0.6.

*Example of river flow and quality correlation of 0.6 for two lognormal distributions. River flow mean and std are 20 and 4.5; river quality mean and std are 4 and 0.9. These values are approximate*

### Monte Carlo

By applying a simple mass balance, the downstream flow and concentration is calculated. A graphical representation of the Monte Carlo method for mixing distributions is shown below.

## Installation

The PyRQP package is available for installation using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/PyRQP/):

```python
pip install PyRQP
```

However, the pip version may lag behind the release version. For the moment I recommend to clone (or simply download) the repository from GitHub and run it directly by using the example notebooks. It is possible to open and run the notebooks using ArcGIS Pro (where SAGIS is usually run) with no need to install any dependencies.

## Examples 

The main library and all its functions can be used calling:

```python
import rqp
```

The following notebook shows a full example of how to use RQP for one case study. The repository contains several [notebooks](https://github.com/PauJuan/PyRQP/tree/main/notebooks) with examples on how to use the library. In my next post I will show how to run RQP in batch using an Excel file.

{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/rqp_simple_example.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/rqp_simple_example.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>

Thanks for reading. If you end up using this library please feel free to drop me an email and let me know. I am happy to provide support where I can.
