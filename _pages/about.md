Hello, I am a scientist working in water quality. This is my personal webpage.

I am a Doctor in Water Science and Technology, with a background in environmental science and a Masters’ in environmental engineering. 

Currently I am working in the Strategic Advisory Services (SAS) Research team in the Water Management Consultancy group at AtkinsRéalis, helping water companies deliver their <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/developing-the-environmental-resilience-and-flood-risk-actions-for-the-price-review-2024/water-industry-national-environment-programme-winep-methodology">WINEP</a> plans for PR24. 

My areas of expertise include water quality and wastewater process modelling, resilience, data analysis, GIS and programming. I am particularly interested in optimisation to support decision making in water management.

I also enjoy developing tools to automate or improve the <a href="https://ukwir.org/sagis">SAGIS-SIMCAT</a> water quality simulation environment from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency">Environment Agency</a> and <a href="https://ukwir.org/">UKWIR</a>.
